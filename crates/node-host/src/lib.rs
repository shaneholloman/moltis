//! Headless node host: connects to a gateway as a node and executes commands.
//!
//! Usage: `moltis node run --host <gateway> --token <device-token>`
//!
//! The node host establishes a WebSocket connection to the gateway,
//! authenticates with a device token, and handles structured `system.exec.v1` commands
//! by executing them locally.
